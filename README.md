# Hugowebsite
###
1.Set up your repository:
Ensure your HTML/CSS website code is hosted in a Git repository. Make sure you have Hugo installed locally and your website can be built successfully using Hugo commands.
###
2.Create a GitHub Actions workflow:
Add a workflow file (e.g., .github/workflows/build1.yml) to your repository.

###
This workflow:
###
i.Triggers on any push event to any branch.
###
ii.Checks out the code.
###
iii.Sets up Hugo.
###
iv.Builds the website using Hugo with minification enabled.
###
v.Archives the built website as an artifact.
###
3.Commit and push the workflow file:
Commit the workflow file to your repository and push it to trigger the workflow.
###
4.Verify the workflow:
Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository to see the status of the workflow. It should run automatically when you push changes to your repository.
###
5.Deploy (Optional):
Depending on your hosting setup, you may want to automate the deployment of the built website. You can add additional steps to the workflow to deploy the website to your hosting platform after it's built.
